    /**
     * Queues supporting work-stealing as well as external task
     * submission. See above for main rationale and algorithms.
     * Implementation relies heavily on "Unsafe" intrinsics
     * and selective use of "volatile":
     *
     * Field "base" is the index (mod array.length) of the least valid
     * queue slot, which is always the next position to steal (poll)
     * from if nonempty. Reads and writes require volatile orderings
     * but not CAS, because updates are only performed after slot
     * CASes.
     *
     * Field "top" is the index (mod array.length) of the next queue
     * slot to push to or pop from. It is written only by owner thread
     * for push, or under lock for external/shared push, and accessed
     * by other threads only after reading (volatile) base.  Both top
     * and base are allowed to wrap around on overflow, but (top -
     * base) (or more commonly -(base - top) to force volatile read of
     * base before top) still estimates size. The lock ("qlock") is
     * forced to -1 on termination, causing all further lock attempts
     * to fail. (Note: we don't need CAS for termination state because
     * upon pool shutdown, all shared-queues will stop being used
     * anyway.)  Nearly all lock bodies are set up so that exceptions
     * within lock bodies are "impossible" (modulo JVM errors that
     * would cause failure anyway.)
     *
     * The array slots are read and written using the emulation of
     * volatiles/atomics provided by Unsafe. Insertions must in
     * general use putOrderedObject as a form of releasing store to
     * ensure that all writes to the task object are ordered before
     * its publication in the queue.  All removals entail a CAS to
     * null.  The array is always a power of two. To ensure safety of
     * Unsafe array operations, all accesses perform explicit null
     * checks and implicit bounds checks via power-of-two masking.
     *
     * In addition to basic queuing support, this class contains
     * fields described elsewhere to control execution. It turns out
     * to work better memory-layout-wise to include them in this class
     * rather than a separate class.
     *
     * Performance on most platforms is very sensitive to placement of
     * instances of both WorkQueues and their arrays -- we absolutely
     * do not want multiple WorkQueue instances or multiple queue
     * arrays sharing cache lines. (It would be best for queue objects
     * and their arrays to share, but there is nothing available to
     * help arrange that). The @Contended annotation alerts JVMs to
     * try to keep instances apart.
